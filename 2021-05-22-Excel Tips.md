## Go to hacks in excel when dealing with large data set

This is simple list (I am aim to build on this)

**Pivot** Easily most used function. Lately I am finding myself trying to use data model
**Vlookup** Little brother of SQL join. Very useful but one must position column and match datatype before running it. Xlookup looks promising btw
**Sumifs, Countifs** Has removed my reliance on pivot but it does slow down the sheet when dataset it big dataset
**IFS** Good alternate to complex nested IF which can take long time to debug
**Multiple Level Sort** Sorts the dataset with primary column first, secondary col second etc
**Show duplicate** Highlight the duplicate
**Drop duplicate**
